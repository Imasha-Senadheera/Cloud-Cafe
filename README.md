# Cloud Cafe Project
## Overview
This project is a simple web application created for self-study and practice with databases, using Firebase Firestore. It allows users to add cafes with names and cities, and the cafes are listed alphabetically. The project includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and utilizes a real-time listener to automatically update the UI when changes occur in the Firestore database.
